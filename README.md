# GameofLife_using_CUDA12.6
This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using CUDA for parallel processing and SDL for graphical rendering. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules, resulting in complex behaviors.
